# Quantitative-Soil-Health
Data and reproducible code for using factor analytic techniques to describe and quantify soil health.
The original intent is to get the data and run the original code. If there are problems resolve them. If successful I will play with the code to better understand the data as time permits.
I am relatively new to Github, so this is partly an excuse to use github. I do not think that I can influence main from this fork without author approval, I hope that is correct.
Sometimes I would like to put my data out for general consumption. I have used data repositories like Harvard dataverse. I am not sure how I feel about using github as a data repository.
Curating massive amounts of data collected through myriad small projects (small relative to total), is in its infancy.
